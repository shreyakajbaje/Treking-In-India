      <p><b>Trekking</b>, as the dictionary defines it, is to go on a long arduous journey, typically on foot. Sounds quite 
          daunting but yet don’t we quite love it! We hike, tramp, march, slog, trudge or plain old walk. Sometimes to discover or 
          to simply to get away from the mundane. It works like magic for most.</p><p>Have you been wanting to go on a trek in the 
          mountains since long, to see those snow-covered peaks whose images you have been scrolling through till now, up-close? 
        Have you always wanted to actually walk through the beautiful and green meadows and not just be satisfied with their 
        photos? Have you been unsure about taking that first step towards preparing yourself for your first trek?</p>
      <p>Worry no more, we will help you with a step-by-step Beginner’s guide for Trekking in India which will prepare you for your 
          first trek to the magical mountains.</p><p>Even though in order to trek anywhere all you need to do is walk, a trek is 
        nothing like your usual walk in the park or a morning stroll. Walking at high altitude is a totally different ball-game 
        altogether and depending upon the length you plan to go up-to, adequate preparation is the most important thing. The length 
        of the trek is another important factor to be kept in mind.</p>
       <p><b>Keep in mind the following things and you should be good to go for trekking in India:</b></p><br>
       <b>1) Types of Treks in India</b>
       <p>‘Trek’ is a very generic word and talking of types of trek, treks can be be anything from an easy one to a moderate one or one that can be really hard a one.</p> 

<p>Easy trek: Generally  a trek stretching for about a couple days and with a decent terrain not involving much highs and lows is considered an easy trek. An easy trek generally involves a not so stressing walk of 4-5 kilometers in a day.  A good example of an easy trek is the Naag Tibba trek which is a short and beautiful trek and can be done in 2.5 days with a night of camping.</p>

<p>Moderate Trek: A trek which involves crossing terrain which need a certain level of stamina, involve multiple days of walk in tougher conditions that pose a higher degree of challenge to the trekker and involves 5-6 hours of walking in a day can be considered to be a moderate trek. The Hampta Pass trek in the Pir Panjal range is one which can be considered a good example of a moderate trek.</p>

<p>Hard Trek: A trek that demands walking long hours per day, through steep inclines and deep gorges. A trek where only stamina is not enough and mental strength is of utmost importance. A trek which involves ascending to altitudes above 14,000 feet ASL and stretches to a week or more is generally considered a hard or tough trek. One that tests many aspects of the trekker and not just his ability to walk. The trek to the Everest Base Camp which reaches up-to a height of more than 17, 500 feet is one of those which is one such trek.</p>
    <b>2) Training yourself for Trekking in India</b><br><br>
    <img src="bg2.jpg" style="height:350px;width:500px;">  
    <p><b>Build stamina:</b> Make your legs strong. Start brisk morning walks followed by jogging at-least a month before the start of your trek. If you are regular at the gym, do more cardio exercises. Along-with the walks, walking with a back-pack weighing similar to the weight you plan to carry on your trek definitely helps.</p>

<p><b>Stop smoking:</b> Smoking and high-altitude does not go hand in hand. When in the high mountains, you would want your lung to be performing at a 100%. As you go up, the oxygen in the air goes down so the more air you suck-in, the better your body will perform. So if you smoke, STOP now. I promise you a trek is much more worth than smoking.</p>

<p>To be fit enough to go on a trek at a short notice, make the following part of your daily routine:</p>    
<p>1.Walk for 5-6 kilometers regularly<br>
2.Try and finish ~ 1.5 kms in around 20 minutes<br>
3.Post the walk, go for a jog<br>
4.Do squats<br>
5.Stand on one leg at a time & try to be straight for half a minute on each<br>
6.Do breathing exercises – inhale/exhale and chest-expansion exercises<br>
7.Do basic shoulder and back exercises to make them strong<br></p>   
    <b>3) Some tips for Trekkers in India</b><br><br>
    <img src="bg3.jpg" style="height:350px;width:500px;">     
    <p>When you’re on the trail, these hacks might help you manage yourself well -</p> 
    <p>1.Distribute load among team members<br>
       2.Carry a stick – helps in walking. Also carry a length of sturdy rope as it helps in tricky situations<br>
       3.Drink water in small quantities at regular intervals, remember to wet your lips<br>
       4.Keep sucking on candies and lozenges (reduces thirst)<br>
       5.You may carry Frisbee/Football to enjoy a game at your camping spot<br>
       6.Boardgames + books + card games<br></p> 
    <p><b>Pack light:</b> Don’t pack everything you can think of when going for a trek. Remember, you are going to the mountains where you would not want to (neither you will have time to) shower daily so there is no point taking 5 pairs of denims and another 5 pairs of your favorite tees. A couple of pairs would actually be more than enough. Take couple of quick-dry clothes instead of denims and cotton tees.</p>

<p><b>Take layered clothing:</b> Weather in the mountains is always un-predictable. It can go from cold to extremely cold to pleasant and back to cold in a matter of minutes. If you are walking, you will feel the change even more. So to be comfortable according to the mood of the weather, the smart way to dress is in layers. Pack two extra light and thin fleece jackets instead of that thick and heavy coat/jacket of yours. Also, when in the mountains never forget your rain coat.</p>

<p><b>Good and well-broken trekking shoes:</b> Get the best and most comfortable pair of trekking-shoes you can afford. Ankle-support is very important so make sure you have that in the pair you pick. Before actually heading to trek, break the shoes as much as you can by wearing them regularly. Trekking with a shoe-bite is no fun.</p>

<p><b>It’s not a race:</b> Remember, the reason you are on a trek is because you wanted to see, experience and be one with nature and not because you wanted to finish it before anyone else. Walk at the pace you are comfortable with and never try to push yourself too much. You will end up doing more bad than good to yourself.</p>

<p><b>Don’t litter:</b> The ecosystem up there is very fragile and it is our responsibility to keep it clean and pure, just the way Mother Nature has made it. So make sure, you don’t litter the place and bring all your garbage with you back to the plains and dispose them at the correct places. Also, if you find any wrappers, plastic or anything that should not be there, pick it up and bring it back to the plains for proper disposal.</p>
<p>Keep re-fueling: Walking at high altitude is demanding and it dehydrates and de-energizes us pretty fast so it is very important to keep drinking lots of water and eating high-energy food as frequently as you can. Chocolates, candies and dry fruits are great options to keep you going.</P>

<p>If you think mere treks are not enough and you are ready to take it to the next level you can always go for Basic (and then Advanced) mountaineering courses.</p>
